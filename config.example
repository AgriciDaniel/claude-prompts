# Claude Prompts -- Configuration Example
#
# This file documents the variables used by the install script.
# You do NOT need to create a config file for normal installation.
# The install script (install.sh / install.ps1) handles everything automatically.
#
# If the installer fails or you need a custom setup, these are the values it uses:

# ---- Path Configuration ----

# Where the repository is cloned (auto-detected by install script)
PROMPT_ENGINE_DIR=/path/to/claude-prompts

# Where Claude Code skills are installed (default: ~/.claude/skills/)
SKILLS_DIR=$HOME/.claude/skills

# ---- Placeholder Substitution ----
#
# SKILL.md files use {PROMPT_ENGINE_DIR} as a placeholder for the repo path.
# The install script replaces all occurrences with the actual path via sed/PowerShell.
#
# Example: {PROMPT_ENGINE_DIR}/scripts/search_prompts.py
# Becomes: /home/user/claude-prompts/scripts/search_prompts.py
#
# If you move the repository after installing, re-run the install script.

# ---- Airtable Scraper (Optional) ----
#
# To add your own prompt sources, edit scripts/scrape_airtable.py and add entries
# to the TABLES dict. No environment variables are needed -- URLs go directly in the script.
#
# The raw/ directory (gitignored) stores intermediate scraping output.
# The prompts/ directory stores the final extracted and categorized prompts.

# ---- Python Requirements ----
#
# Core (search and extraction): Python 3.10+ (standard library only)
# Scraper (optional): pip install playwright && playwright install chromium
